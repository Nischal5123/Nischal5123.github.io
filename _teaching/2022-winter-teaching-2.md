In this course we will learn a lot of interesting stuff about modern operating systems, such as, communicating with them using system calls, creating and managing multiple processes at once, creating multiple threads, getting processes and threads to synchronize their actions, and how processes can communicate with each other, when they are on the same machine, as well as over the network. We will be extensively using Unix, C and its libraries, and Rust in this course. You are not expected to know C or Rust coming into the course, and the knowledge of these languages needed in this course will be taught in the course.
