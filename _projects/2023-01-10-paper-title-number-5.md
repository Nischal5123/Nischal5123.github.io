Exploratory visual analysis (EVA) is an essential stage of the
data science pipeline, where users often lack clear analysis
goals at the start and iteratively refine them as they learn
more about their data. Accurate models of users’ exploration
behavior are becoming increasingly vital to developing re-
sponsive and personalized tools for exploratory visual analy-
sis. Yet we observe a discrepancy between the static view of
human exploration behavior adopted by many computational
models versus the dynamic nature of EVA. In this paper, we
explore potential parallels between the evolution of users’
interactions with visualization tools during data exploration
and assumptions made in popular online learning techniques.
Through a series of empirical analyses, we seek to answer the
question: how might users’ exploration behavior evolve in re-
sponse to what they have learned from the data during EVA?
We present our findings and discuss their implications for the
future of user modeling for system design.
