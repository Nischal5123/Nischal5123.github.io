This project proposes a deep learning-based approach
that simulates the user-feedback loop in entity matching
and relevance modeling without the need for costly and
time-consuming data collection. Our method formulates
the relevancy modeling problem as a text/entity matching
task and leverages NLP techniques to learn matching patterns from logged interactions. We evaluate our approach
on datasets from three popular domains and show its effectiveness, achieving close human performance. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates robust performance on
complex negative samples, indicating its potential to benefit
any domain that relies on user feedback
