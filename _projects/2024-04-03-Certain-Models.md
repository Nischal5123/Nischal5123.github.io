Real-world data is often incomplete and contains missing values.
To train accurate models over real-world datasets, users need to
spend a substantial amount of time and resources imputing and
finding proper values for missing data items. In this paper, we
demonstrate that it is possible to learn accurate models directly from
data with missing values for certain training data and target models.
We propose a unified approach for checking the necessity of data
imputation to learn accurate models across various widely-used
machine learning paradigms. We build efficient algorithms with
theoretical guarantees to check this necessity and return accurate
models in cases where imputation is unnecessary. Our extensive
experiments indicate that our proposed algorithms significantly
reduce the amount of time and effort needed for data imputation
without imposing considerable computational overhead.
