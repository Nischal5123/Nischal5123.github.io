The agriculture and farming industry plays a vital role in the economy. However, the importance of agriculture cannot be fully quantified in terms of its economic profit. Agriculture affecting global hunger is a much more sensitive and vital topic. One of the leading reasons for this is un-improvised crop production. Crop production is affected by various factors, and monitoring those factors is the key to solving the problem. This paper describes a comprehensive experiment predicting the cotton yield under various environments, such as Acres Harvested, Acres Planted, Soil pH, Bulk Density, Clay-High, Clay-Low, Organic-Carbon, and Water-Area.
