I am a Computer Science Graduate student at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/about), [Information & Data Management and Analytics (IDEA) Lab](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/idea/). My research is guided by [Professor Arash Termehchy](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/arash-termehchy) and [Professor Leilani Battle](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~leibatt/projects.html).


I conduct research in the area of Information Visualization and Data Science for ML. We build [interactive data-centric systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-jST9ShrfU) that [collaborate with humans](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/idea/sites/research.engr.oregonstate.edu.idea/files/aaai24_caihu.pdf) to achieve common goals, e.g., training Machine learning (ML) models or exploring data, empowering end-users to better understand their data, develop insights, and communicate results.
I also study challenges at other stages of the data science pipeline, such as data cleaning. For instance, by design methods to train accurate [ML models over dirty data without any cleaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBd7OrUfBBk), minimizing human intervention in data synthesis.

I also support various graduate and undergraduate courses as a Graduate Assistant.

- **Machine/Reinforcement Learning**
- **Information Visualization**
- **Data Science**
- **Human-Computer-Interaction**


My background is in ML/Data Engineering and Software Development. 
I previously interned at Strategic Systems, [Alfa Insurance](https://www.alfainsurance.com/about-alfa), where I rotated roles in an Agile software development cycle. I also worked as a Software Engineer at Alfa Insurance, specializing in MuleSoft development. Most recently, I completed a ML/Data Engineering internship at [Slalom Build](https://www.slalombuild.com/data-engineering), where I researched and developed an end-to-end data pipeline to infer employee happiness index
