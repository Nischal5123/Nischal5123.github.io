I am a Computer Science Graduate student at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/about), [Information & Data Management and Analytics (IDEA) Lab](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/idea/). My research is guided by [Professor Arash Termehchy](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/arash-termehchy) and [Professor Leilani Battle](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~leibatt/projects.html).


I conduct research in broadly in the area of Human Data Interaction. We build [interactive data-centric systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-jST9ShrfU) that [collaborate with humans](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/idea/sites/research.engr.oregonstate.edu.idea/files/aaai24_caihu.pdf) to achieve common goals, e.g., training Machine learning (ML) models or exploring data, empowering end-users to better understand their data, develop insights, and communicate results.
I also study challenges at other stages of the ML pipeline, such as data cleaning. For instance, by design methods to train accurate [ML models over dirty data without any cleaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBd7OrUfBBk), minimizing human intervention in data synthesis.



- **Machine/Reinforcement Learning**
- **Information Visualization**
- **Data Science**
- **Human-Computer-Interaction**


Apart from research, my hands on technical and product delivery background is as a Data Scientist, Data/ML Engineer and Software Engineer.

I also mentor ~30 undergraduates year round for CS Capstone projects and support other graduate courses at OSU.
