I am a Computer Science Graduate student at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/about), [Information & Data Management and Analytics (IDEA) Lab](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/idea/). My research is guided by [Professor Arash Termehchy](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/arash-termehchy) and [Professor Leilani Battle](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~leibatt/projects.html).


I conduct research in the area of Information Visualization and Data Science for ML. We study and develop interactive data interfaces to help people understand their data, develop insights, and communicate results effectively. 
My recent research involves analyzing user learning patterns in visual data exploration tasks in order to model human learning and biases for developing Adaptive Data Exploration Systems. 
I also support various graduate and undergraduate courses as a Graduate Assistant.

- **Information Visualization**
- **Data Science**
- **Human-Computer-Interaction**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

My background is in ML/Data Engineering and Software Development. 
I previously interned at Strategic Systems, [Alfa Insurance](https://www.alfainsurance.com/about-alfa), where I rotated roles in an Agile software development cycle. I also worked as a Software Engineer at Alfa Insurance, specializing in MuleSoft development. Most recently, I completed a ML/Data Engineering internship at [Slalom Build](https://www.slalombuild.com/data-engineering), where I researched and developed an end-to-end data pipeline to infer employee happiness index
